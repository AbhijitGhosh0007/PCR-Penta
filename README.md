# PCR-Penta

This project is all about solving a batch of pentadiagonal systems
in a GPU where our newly developed parallel cyclic reduction (PCR)
algorithm is used.

Given a batch of pentadiagonal systems with batch size m and system size n,
implementation is divided into two parts: n<=1024 and n>1024.

A link for the documentation of this project will be updated soon.
